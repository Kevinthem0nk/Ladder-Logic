# Ladder Logic Examples Using PLC Fiddle

## Simple example of a staged process. 5 stations that rotate with one active station at a time. 
### I tried to come up with a Semi-Real-World scenario that would need a staged process to create an example program using whatever I currently had access to.

## Occupancy Counter
### This is from PLC Fiddle's Occupancy Counter Challenge that I created.

## P, PI, or PID Control Loop
### This is a program to switch between control modes. PLC Fiddle is very limited and cycles slowly so the actual function of the PID is not performing to my liking at least... 
- Set the target value (default 1018) with HMItarget.
- Set 1 of P_Enbl, PI_Enbl, or PID_Enbl to select which.
- The Start Button works to Start and Stop. Single click for function.
- The Stop works as Stop & Reset. Single click for function.
